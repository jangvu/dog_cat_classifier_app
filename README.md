# dog_cat_classifier_app
A small computer vision project using Dogs and Cats data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)

I applied Data Augmentation by using ImageGenerator and tested some use cases to measure their performances

The final model was trained by using VGG16 + Data Augementation
